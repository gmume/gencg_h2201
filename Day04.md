# Day 04

## Drawing machines

"Create a program that expands, augment, distort, questions, complicate, interpret, improves the act of drawing." was the task to do on day 4. How could I interprete this? I always found the kind of drawing machins or tools that were alike spyrographs fascinating. In my researches I stumbled upon something called benic equation. It was like everyone uses this to create beautifull spyrograph designs, but I wasn't able to find any more information about it. However I was hooked.

## Spyrograph
Based on an idea from Daniel Shiffman I started to create code. Soon I was able to animate circles that rotate around each other.

In a second step I let the smallest circle draw a line using its center.

After some more work the machine did what it should.

{% endraw %}

And after adding more lines from other circles it became really beautifull.
