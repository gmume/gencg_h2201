## Pixels

The last new task for this course was all about pixels. Because I already used the pixels of images yesterday I decided to work on this project in 3D space further. First of all I added to the x and y dimentions a z dimention. To do so I put darker shaded pixels more in the back than the lighter ones.

In a next stepp I colored the spheres representing the pixels in their original shade.

And just for fun I tryed how it would be to color the spheres in their full color.
