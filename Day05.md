# Day 05

## Reflect / Collect / Prepare

I used the time today to finish the clock project, meaning I implemented the minutes that are represented by a box turning red after a full minute. Now it works until an hour.

## Journal

As I was completing this journal I recalled how the challanges of every day this week passed. I saw how fun it was to make disturbing eyes or how beautifull the spyrograph drawings became. But also how I struggled with the space flight that I had to give up although I'm not a person to do so easily. All in all I'm proud of what I could do and maybe I should allow myselfe to kill my darlings sooner if I struggle too much. Anyway I'm looking forward to next weeks challanges.
