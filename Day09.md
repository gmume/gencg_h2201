# Day 09

## Preparing for the presentation

There isn't really mutch to say about. I just completed the journal. The only thing that was tricky, was, that within the iframes of the journal or even the links the coordinates for the camera won't get set in 3D. In projects without orbitcontrol there is no way to show them properly. So I had to find a work around with videos.
